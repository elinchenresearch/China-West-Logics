# China–West-Logics

## Overview
The **China–West Logics** repository explores the structural differences and interactions between two epistemic systems.  
It goes beyond surface contrasts to examine how each frames **self, time, and contradiction**, and how these foundations shape misreadings in governance, AI ethics, and global narratives.  

This module is part of the broader **Epistemic Autarchy System**, but stands as an independent framework for analyzing the logic-patterns unique to the China–West dynamic.  

---

## Core Dimensions
- **Self** – externalized into religion vs internally contained.  
- **Time** – linear past–present–future vs present-locked continuity.  
- **Contradiction** – rejection vs tolerance/absorption.  
- **Context Density** – compression and long-term tension management vs expansion and externalization.  

---

## Applications
- **AI Ethics** – how misreadings of contradiction and context affect global AI debates.  
- **Governance** – different tolerance for paradox and long-term tension in institutions.  
- **Narratives** – how China and the West interpret each other’s signals through structural misalignment.  

---

## Relation to Other Modules
- Linked to **Epistemic-Autarchy** as a case framework.  
- Complements the **Context-Lattice-System** by showing how cross-context misalignments emerge.  
- Supports the **Karma-System** in analyzing feedback loops across cultural logics.

## Disclaimer
⚠️ This repository contains **ongoing structural research**.  
The materials here are exploratory frameworks, not finalized theories.  
Naming conventions (self, time, contradiction) are **temporary scaffolds** that may shift as the work develops.
